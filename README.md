Inholland Air webapplication
codename: RobTheWebShop
(thats just the name, don't actualy rob us)

to use the dbimplement branch make sure to have the database package installed
ask jaap on how to set up the database.

you also have to uninstall kore and rebuild it with the line PGSQL=1
added to the Makefile, i think thats how you're supposed to do it.
else the server will crash emediently.
