//		other than making a hash. The only problem I have is converting the 
//		"randomhash" and making it a readable hexstring from it.
//@input:	nothing, just make the salt for me please...
//@output:	Char* of the salt.
char* generateSalt(void)

	randNumber = randomNumber();
	
	snprintf(numberString, sizeof(numberString),  "%u", randNumber);
	
	salt = hashString(numberString);
	return salt;
